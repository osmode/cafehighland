# Cafe Highland
Lightweight web app for curating knowledge among online communities

## What?
Cafe Highland is a lightweight website that lets community members ask questions and answer each others' questions by posting links.
Users earn points when others upvote their links. It functions like a cross between link-sharing websites (like hacker news) and sites like reddit. There is not commenting by design.

## Who?
Anyone can clone this website and re-brand it for your own organization according to the license.

## Why?
Many organizations ineffectively curate information, resulting in poor digital resource utilization. Cafe Highland creates a community around knowledge sharing and helps communities create and share knowledge more dynamically than organizational intranets and static wikis.

## How?
Cafe Highland was built using the web2py framework.
